[**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Medium

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** 

**substring**

 without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```


**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


### Brute Force Approach

2 loop for finding all substring and 1 loop to check if all characters are unique

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n^3)
- Space complexity: O(n)

### Better Approach

### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(2n) // each char visited twice in wc 
- Space complexity: O(n)
    
We will have two pointers left and right. Pointer ‘left’ is used for maintaining the starting point of the substring while ‘right’ will maintain the endpoint of the substring.’ right’ pointer will move forward and check for the duplicate occurrence of the current element if found then the ‘left’ pointer will be shifted ahead so as to delete the duplicate elements.

#### Code

```javascript
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    let map = {};
    let ans = 0;
    let l = 0, r = 0;

    while (r < s.length) {
        if (map[s[r]] !== undefined) {
            while (l < r && map[s[r]] !== undefined) {
                delete map[s[l]];
                l++;
            }
        } 
        ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);
        map[s[r]] = r;

        r++;
    }

    return ans;
}
```

### Optimized Approach

### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

In this approach, we will make a map that will take care of counting the elements and maintaining the frequency of each and every element as a unity by taking the latest index of every element. This will help us in long jump rather than one by one.

### Simple solution

```javascript
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    let map = {};
    let ans = 0;
    let l = 0, r = 0;

    while (r < s.length) {
        if (map[s[r]] !== undefined) {
            // e.g abcaab - here left will be at index 1 and right will be at 4. 
            // if you see object, key b will have value of 1 so we can't directly say left = map[s[right]] + 1. as left could be already ahead.

            // i.e  update left ptr iff value is in range [l, r]
            if (map[s[r]] >= l && map[s[r]] <= r) {
                l = map[s[r]] + 1;
                map[s[r]] = r;
            } else {
                ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);
                map[s[r]] = r;
            }
        } else {
            ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);
            map[s[r]] = r;
        }
        r++;
    }

    return ans;
};
```

### Efficient solution
update left pointer w.r.t max of it and map[s[r]] + 1. In this way if Object key is pointing older value then left can stay at the same place.

```javascript
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    let map = {};
    let ans = 0;
    let l = 0, r = 0;

    while (r < s.length) {
        
        if (map[s[r]] !== undefined) {
            l = Math.max(l, map[s[r]] + 1);
        } 

        ans = Math.max(ans, r-l+1);
        map[s[r]] = r;
        r++;
    }

    return ans;
};
```
